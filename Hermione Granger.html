    <p>
    <h4>Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in the Harry Potter
        series of novels by J. K. Rowling. She first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), as a
        first-year student on her way to Hogwarts. She becomes friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley after they save her
        from a troll in the girls' bathroom. Hermione often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to
        help
        her friends in perilous situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her
        insecurity and fear of failure.[2]
    
        Hermione has been immensely popular. The version of the character portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight Harry Potter
        films was voted the best female character of all time in a 2016 poll of Hollywood professionals conducted by The
        Hollywood Reporter.[3]</h4>
